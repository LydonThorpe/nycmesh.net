If you would like to connect your whole building to the Mesh, we have a new streamlined process. This is for over 6 apartments. Buildings over ~80 apartments will be considered for fiber connections and we will handle fiber leases as well. Our Grand Street project has hundreds of apartments sharing a 40 gigabit fiber connection, so large projects are welcome.

We will help you with-
* Scheduling
* Payment management
* Management companies
* Dedicated high-bandwidth connections
* Zoom and coop meeting attendance
* Lease and insurance paperwork if needed
* Dedicated Mesh contact to coordinate everything

For new buildings we will work with construction companies and architects to plan and run cables during construction. We are working on a few new buildings at the moment.

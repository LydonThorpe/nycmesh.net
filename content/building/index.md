If you would like to connect your whole building to the Mesh, we have a new streamlined process. This is for over 6 apartments. Buildings over ~80 apartments will be considered for fiber connections and we will handle fiber leases as well. Our Grand Street project has hundreds of apartments sharing a 40 gigabit fiber connection, so large projects are welcome.

NYC Mesh can connect all the apartments in your building. We work with coop boards, tenant associations, management companies, construction companies etc.

We will help you with-
* Scheduling
* Payment management
* Dedicated high-bandwidth connections
* Zoom and coop meeting attendance
* Lease and insurance paperwork if needed
* Dedicated Mesh contact to coordinate everything
